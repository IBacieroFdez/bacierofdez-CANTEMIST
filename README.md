# bacierofdez-CANTEMIST
This GitHub repository contains all the documents that univocally define the project developed as part of the participation in the shared task CANTEMIST organized by the Spanish government's TL plan and the Barcelona super computing center. More precisely, it includes the following documents needed to carry out the Nominal Entity Recognition (NER) task.


The recognition of any kind of concept in natural text (called entity recognition, NER) is a core technology for automatic or semi-automatic analysis of textual resources. NER task is the previous step for many applications that work on text, such as information retrieval, information extraction, or document classification. In recent years, the problem has received considerable attention in the bioinformatics community and experience has shown that NER in the life sciences is a rather difficult problem. Several systems and algorithms have been developed and applied in the field of biomedical sciences. The paper adjoining this repository describes how this task is performed in some Spanish medical records, and how the algorithm has been developed the application of NER research.

The detailed hands-on of this project will be released soon at this GitHub repository README.
